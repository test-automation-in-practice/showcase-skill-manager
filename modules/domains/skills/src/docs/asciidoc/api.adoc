== Important Notes

**Why are freshly created skills not immediately reflected in search results?**

Searching or getting suggestions for skills makes use of the search index's advanced querying capabilities.
A drawback of this approach is the fact that changes to the search index are only eventually consistent.
This has two reasons:

1. The search index is updated asynchronously.
2. The search index itself is optimized for write operations and only updates itself with new changes on a fixed delay (e.g. every 1.5 seconds).

This is why freshly created skills might not be included immediately in search results.
The following diagram illustrates this point further:
