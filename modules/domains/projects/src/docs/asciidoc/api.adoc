include::{snippets}/projects/create/bad-request/http-response.adoc[]

==== Get

An existing project be got by sending a request like this:

include::{snippets}/projects/get-by-id/not-found/http-response.adoc[]

==== Get Page

A page of all existing projects can be got by sending a request like this:

include::{snippets}/projects/get-page/multiple-pages/http-request.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/projects/get-page/multiple-pages/http-response.adoc[]

Pagination parameters are _optional_, if none are provided the first page with a default size is returned:

include::{snippets}/projects/get-page/multiple/http-request.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/projects/get-page/multiple/http-response.adoc[]

In case there are no projects to be found, the response will look like this:

include::{snippets}/projects/get-page/empty/http-response.adoc[]

==== Update

include::{snippets}/projects/update/put/updated/http-response.adoc[]

=== Querying

==== Search

include::{snippets}/projects/search/multiple/http-request.adoc[]

== Important Notes

**Why are freshly created projects not immediately reflected in search results?**

Searching or getting suggestions for projects makes use of the search index's advanced querying capabilities.
A drawback of this approach is the fact that changes to the search index are only eventually consistent.
This has two reasons:

1. The search index is updated asynchronously.
2. The search index itself is optimized for write operations and only updates itself with new changes on a fixed delay (e.g. every 1.5 seconds).

This is why freshly created projects might not be included immediately in search results.
The following diagram illustrates this point further:
